### Overview
The Twitter Quote Bot is a Python application that automatically posts random quotes to [my Anders bot](https://x.com/AndersApostate) (a character from Dragon Age 2) and responds to mentions. The bot fetches quotes from a predefined list and posts them as tweets at regular intervals. Additionally, it monitors for mentions and replies with a quote if mentioned.

### Features
Automatic Posting: Posts a new quote to Twitter at a specified interval (e.g., daily).
Random Quote Selection: Chooses a random quote from a predefined list of quotes.
Respond to Mentions: Monitors for mentions and responds with a random quote.
Error Handling: Catches and reports errors encountered during the posting and responding processes.

### Error Handling
The script includes basic error handling for issues encountered while posting quotes or responding to mentions. Errors will be printed to the console, allowing you to troubleshoot any problems.
